# A Physical Intelligent Instrument using Recurrent Neural Networks
Code and files from my master's project.

The "training" folder contains the scripts to create datasets and train generative music models used in the instrument.
The "instrument" folder contains the scripts that run on the Raspberry Pi, in addition to three pre-trained models.

A demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya4gcIvtaEE)

Link to the paper describing the first instrument prototype: [paper_nime_2019.pdf](https://www.nime.org/proceedings/2019/nime2019_paper016.pdf)

Schematics for the instrument will be added soon.
