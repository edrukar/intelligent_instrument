# This repository is under development
The paper ([paper_nime_2019.pdf](https://github.com/edrukar/intelligent_instrument/blob/master/paper_nime_2019.pdf)) describes the first instrument prototype. The instrument presented during the poster session at NIME 2019 is the second prototype which has more functionality.

Source code and technical specifications for both versions will be added soon.
